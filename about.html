        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>One of the most difficult tasks one encounters when teaching students about medieval
            texts and textual practices is to distance them from contemporary notions of
            “originality” and “authorship” and to immerse them in the world of the medieval
            reader-compiler, who does things with texts previously read and memorized—assigning them
            new meanings in occasional contexts, reworking them with rhetorical tropes, and
            ultimately applying them to his or her own life in an effort at conversion, to “become
            the text.” A great deal of writing in the Middle Ages is just such a re-elaboration of,
            reordering of, or gloss upon an earlier text. Emphasizing logical argumentation and
            “originality,” modern pedagogues leave little room for an understanding of the way most
            of the world worked with text until a few hundred years ago (and much of it still
            does).</p>
        <p>The present edition of the East Slavic work(s) attributed to “Daniel the Prisoner” has
            been designed as an interactive virtual <em>florilegium</em>, a “collection of flowers”
            culled from the medieval compiler’s garden of readings. It provides students of medieval
            European literatures with an on-line, XML-based, English-language “memory palace” where
            they can follow the creation of a new writing out of older ones and in turn compile
            their own medieval-style text. With artificial memory standing in for the lost <em>ars
                memoriae</em>, this edition opens a textual window onto the Middle Ages, through
            which students can recover the habits of the medieval monastic reader and experience the
            principles that guided medieval textual compilation.</p>
        <h2>Theoretical background</h2>
        <p>The text (or rather, pair of texts) attributed to “Daniel the Prisoner” (Daniil Zatočnik)
            has been called one of the most original works of Early East Slavic literature, although
            it consists largely of material borrowed from elsewhere. It is “Daniel’s” virtuoso
            reordering and re-elaboration of his sources that has tempted students and scholars into
            imagining a creative author at work. There are two main <em>redactions</em> or versions,
            the twelfth-century <cite>Slovo Daniila Zatočnika</cite> (“Word of Daniel the Prisoner”)
            and the thirteenth-century <cite>Molenie Daniila Zatočnika</cite> (“Supplication of
            Daniel the Prisoner”). Though the textual core of both texts consists largely of the
            same material, the two redactions (and even manuscripts within the redactions) differ
            significantly in their use and arrangement of this material. Either one could have been
            compiled from the other. Indeed it may be said that the “Daniel” texts, like other
            florilegia, defeat traditional textual criticism: while the <cite>Slovo</cite> may
            reflect an earlier arrangement of textual material, the <cite>Molenie</cite> may be
            primary at the micro-level, in places more closely reflecting its sources than the
                <cite>Slovo</cite>.</p>
        <p>Traditional scholarship held that the <cite>Slovo</cite> and <cite>Molenie</cite> were
            variants of an actual epistle, and thus focused on problems of the purported author’s
            social position and the text’s social function. Some noted the similarity of the
            “Daniel” texts to the Byzantine genres of the begging poem and mirror of princes. In
            1997, the late Henrik Birnbaum and one of the present authors argued that the variegated
            contents, kaleidoscopic structure, and fluid manuscript tradition of the Daniel texts
            could be explained against monastic meditative-compilatory practices. These are
            expressed in the common medieval metaphor (used by “Daniel” himself) of the
            reader-compiler as a bee floating from flower to flower, taking what he or she needs
            from each. Jean Leclercq has described these practices in his classic <cite>The Love of
                Learning and the Desire for God</cite>:</p>
        <p class="block">The monk would copy out texts he had enjoyed so as to savor them at leisure
            and use them anew as subjects for private meditation. The monastic florilegium not only
            originated in the monk’s spiritual reading but always remained closely associated with
            it The florilegia, in which reading and prayer become as one, provided the best possible
            means for the kind of meditation closest to their hearts, a means completely devoid of
            any method. (73–74)</p>
        <p>Leclercq may overstate his case somewhat, as there is a discernable method at work in
            monastic compilation—that of the weaver of a fabric, another of “Daniel’s” metaphors.
            Leclercq himself describes meditative prayer, the basis of monastic compilation, as</p>
        <p class="block">a chain reaction of associations which will bring together words that have
            no more than a chance connection … Each word is like a hook, so to speak; it catches
            hold of one or several others which become linked together and make up the fabric of the
            exposé. (182–84)</p>
        <p>A florilegium, according to Mary Carruthers in <cite>The Book of Memory</cite>, is
            “basically the contents of someone's memory, set forth as a kind of study-guide for the
            formation of others’ memories” (174). In her <cite>The Craft of Thought</cite>,
            Carruthers notes that the more surprising a turn of phrase, “arousing emotions of fear
            or delight, wonder and awe” (117), the more firmly it punctures a given sentence in the
            heart of the monk, and the more effective the ensuing compunction. Paradoxically, a
            “difficult trope” kept the meditating mind on track at the same time that it diverted
            it; it forged the associative chain at the very place that it broke it. Consider the
            passage near the beginning of the <cite>Slovo</cite>, a reminiscence of Ps. 136:9,
            elaborated with a condensed memory-image of writing on the heart and the associative
            chains forged thereby: “Because of this I tried to write down every link of my heart,
            and struck them apart evilly, like the bygone infants against the rock.” The trope
            attests to its own effect: it breaks the associative chain with a striking (indeed,
            traumatically violent) ornament at the same time that it is a product of that
            association.</p>
        <p>That the <cite>Slovo</cite> and <cite>Molenie</cite> are replete with citations from
            various sources has long been recognized and is a factor common to many genres of
            medieval writing. What “Daniel” shares specifically with the florilegia are the “chance
            connections” of his textual chains, resulting from the verbal “hooks” of his meditative
            work. Consider the following passage from the <cite>Molenie</cite>:</p>
        <p class="block">As I say, so it will be; I command to flee, and they flee; I command to
            pursue, and they pursue. <em title="Cf. Deut 32:30.">One will pursue a hundred and a
                hundred will move tens of thousands.</em>
            <em title="Cf. Ps 124 (125):1.">He who trusts in me is like the mountain Sion, he will
                not be moved in the ages.</em></p>
        <p>Here we find three sentences (two of them being scriptural citations) linked together by
            two words, <em>pursue</em> and <em>move</em>. <em>Pursue</em> occurs in the first and
            second sentences while <em>move</em> occurs in the second and third. The sentences are
            linked on the basis of the repeating words, not by any systematic thought. Or consider
            the following passages:</p>
        <p class="block">O my prince, O lord! <em title="Cf. Sir 12:10.">Rust eats iron, and sorrow
                a man’s mind;</em>
            <em title="Cf. Job 13:28: Is 50:9.">a moth damages garments, and sorrow a man’s
                mind.</em> Just as tin poured too often is destroyed, thus too a man, receiving much
            misfortune, grows wretched; <em title="Cf. Prov 17:22.">for they (misfortunes) dry up a
                sorrowful man’s bones.</em></p>
        <p class="block"><em title="Cf. Sir 2:5.">For gold is tried by fire, and man by
                adversity;</em> wheat ground much shows forth clean bread, and a man, tolerating
            misfortune, seems thoughtful and wise. For whoever will not have been in much
            misfortune, like at the devil in his fumes, in him there is no cognition.</p>
        <p>Here “Daniel” contradicts himself, claiming first that man is destroyed by misfortune,
            then that misfortune brings wisdom. The first excerpt consists entirely of citations
            from Sirach, Job, and Proverbs, while the second begins with a quotation from Sirach and
            may continue with aphorisms whose source is not yet known. In each we see the repetition
            of the words <em>sorrow</em> and <em>misfortune</em>. Like a bee floating from flower to
            flower or a weaver of fabric, “Daniel” selects material to be used on distinct
            occasions, and his <cite>Slovo</cite> and <cite>Molenie</cite> may be considered his
            honeycomb or brocade.</p>
        <h2>The present edition</h2>
        <p>The translation of the texts in this edition aims at a one-to-one correspondence between
            English and Slavic word roots. While complete consistency is not possible, through a
            process of trial and error and the construction of a concordance of Slavic roots and
            their English equivalents, we have succeeded to a large degree in preserving the basic
            texture of the Slavic text and the repetitions of words formed from a common root. This
            has meant that at times the precise meaning of a word has been sacrificed to maintain
            the literal meaning of the word’s root(s). For example, the Slavic compound
                <em>dobrorazumie</em>, a calque of the Greek <em>eugnômosynê</em>, meaning
            “right-mindedness” (hence “candor,” “gratitude,” “loyalty,” or “generosity” in various
            contexts) has been translated as “good reason,” the meaning of its roots. This method of
            translation should make the verbal cues that guided monastic compilers more readily
            visible to the English reader.</p>
        <p>Our edition provides the texts of the <cite>Slovo</cite> and <cite>Molenie</cite> in two
            parallel windows. When the reader selects a textual unit in one window, the
            corresponding unit(s) will appear in the other window. Thus the reader may read text in
            one version and its analogue in the other at the same time. A map in the form of a
            paired <em>plectogram</em>, simulating the well-trained memory of the medieval compiler,
            shows the reader’s place in both versions and helps him or her see the relations between
            florilegia where traditional stemmata fail. The reader may switch from version to
            version and continue reading at any time (clicking on the title <cite>Slovo</cite> or
                <cite>Molenie</cite> expands the text again), or browse the units in a non-linear
            way, like a medieval reader-bee hovering over the text. Medieval memory is also
            simulated by the ability to search for words or word-roots in each text. For the moment,
            the browser’s search function fulfills this role.</p>
        <p>The medieval reader, steeped in the text of the Psalms, wisdom books, and many other
            authoritative writings, would quickly recognize “Daniel’s” many borrowings. We have
            implemented a source window, alerting the reader to these scriptural sources: a
            mouse-over provides the relevant passage itself. Scholars such as Mindalev, Thomson,
            Colucci and Danti, and others have identified extra-scriptural sources such as the “Bee”
                (<cite>Pchela</cite>) miscellany and the <cite>Tale of Akir the Wise</cite>; these
            will be added in the future. Visual aids, such as the frescoes of Byzantine circus
            performers in Kyiv’s Cathedral of St. Sophia (cf. the somewhat confused
                <em>ecphrasis</em> or description of such a performance in the
            <cite>Molenie</cite>), will eventually be included as well.</p>
        <h2>Pedagogical applications</h2>
        <p>Following the principles of reading and compilation outlined above, “Daniel” offers a
            paradigmatically “readerly” text. His style is attractive, as many of his sentences have
            been ornamented using the striking rhetoric that, as scholars believe, served the work
            of memory and the ethics of reading. Students will enjoy reading his florilegium, while
            gaining knowledge of how books and texts were read, understood, and compiled in the
            Middle Ages, and the themes and problems that interested readers of the time. Rooted in
            the scriptural inheritance common to West and East (the wisdom books of the Bible in
            particular), it is organized into ethical themes: wisdom and folly, charity and greed,
            the fear and love of God, friendship, wealth and poverty, grief and joy, lying and
            slander, princely power, and self-love. The extended misogynistic chapter in the
                <cite>Slovo</cite> should be of interest to instructors who teach gender studies and
            monastic culture in their courses, while the satirical chapter against unworthy monks
            and aristocrats in the <cite>Molenie</cite> may serve as an introduction to
            “carnivalesque,” anti-establishment tendencies in the Middle Ages. As noted earlier, the
                <cite>Molenie</cite> contains an ecphrasis of a Hippodrome scene, which may serve to
            introduce the theme of “translation” from a visual to a verbal language.</p>
        <p>Sample assignments for a course in the Literature of Old Rus′ might include the
            following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>The following headings are taken from the “Bee,” a popular florilegium: <em>good
                        deeds and evil, wisdom, manliness and strength, truth, brotherly love and
                        friendship, charity, power and rule, lie and slander, wealth and poverty,
                        study, anger, silence, passion, sin and confession, gluttony , sadness and
                        happiness, drunkenness, pride, beauty, glory, talkativeness, faith, memory,
                        the soul, law, madness, self-love, death, women, old age and youth,
                        patience</em>.</p>
                <p>Making use of these headings, compile a florilegium based on “Daniel’s” material
                    and other course materials. Your compilation must consist entirely of found
                    text, which must be reordered so that it no longer resembles the source.
                    Identify the source of each passage in footnotes, and show (using italics) the
                    links joining them, whether "things" (or topics), <em>ad res</em>, or "words,"
                        <em>ad verbum</em>.</p></li>
            <li><p>“Daniel” claims to be an exile or prisoner. How does this social position
                    legitimate his ordering and choice of texts—or, conversely, how might his choice
                    and ordering of texts have led later readers to “locate” him in exile?</p></li>

             (0) The word of Daniel the Prisoner, which he wrote to his prince Iaroslav
            Volodimerovich.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cd" name="1"><h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p class="1" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',1)">
             (1) Let us trumpet, as on gold-forged trumpets, in our mind’s reason, and we will
            strike on silver organs [in the unwinding of] our wisdom, letting forth God-inspired
            pipes, so that we applaud you, O soul-profiting thoughts. Arise my glory, arise in
            psaltery and lutes: I will arise early. I will confess to you, so that I open my riddles
            in parables and announce among the tongues my glory. For the heart of a thoughtful man
            becomes strong in his body through beauty and wisdom.</p>
        <p class="2" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',2,5)">
             (2) My tongue became like the reed of a quick-writing scribe, and (my) comforting mouth
            like fast speech. Because of this I tried to write down every link of my heart, and
            struck them apart evilly, like the bygone infants against the rock.</p>
        <p class="3" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',3,77)">
             (3) But I fear, O lord, your censure upon me.</p>
        <p class="4" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',3,4)">
             (4) For I am like that accursed fig tree; I do not have fruit for repentance. For I
            have a heart like a face without eyes, and my mind became like a night raven on a ruin;
            I watched and my life crumbled like the Canaanite king in haughtiness, and destitution
            covered me, like the Black Sea the Pharaoh.</p>
        <p class="5" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',5,6)">
             (5) Lo, I wrote, fleeing from the face of my craft, like Hagar the slave-girl from
            Sarah her mistress.</p>
        <p class="6" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',7,45,17)">
             (6) But I saw, O lord, your good-heartedness toward me and I ran to your customary
            love. For Scripture speaks: give to him who asks of you, open to him who knocks, lest
            you be deprived of the Kingdom of Heaven. For it is written: cast your sorrow on the
            Lord, and He will sustain you in the ages.</p>

             (7) For I am, O prince, O lord, like pale grass, growing by a wall, upon which neither
            the sun shines nor the rain falls; thus I too am offended by all, because I am fenced-in
            by fright of your threat, as by a firm bulwark.</p>

    <div class="cd" name="3"><h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        <p class="8" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',16)">
             (8) But do not look upon me, O lord, like a wolf at a lamb, but look upon me like a
            mother at an infant. Look upon the birds of Heaven, as they neither plow nor sow, but
            hope on God’s mercy. Thus I, O lord, wish for your mercy, like a hart for streams of
            water.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cd" name="4"><h2>Chapter 4</h2>
        <p class="9" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',41)">
             (9) Because, O lord, to one is Bogoliubivo, but to me it is ferocious bitterness; to
            one is White Lake, but to me it blacker than pitch; to one is Lake Lache, but to me,
            sitting there, it is bitter weeping; and to one is Novgorod, but to me even the
            corner(stones) have fallen, because my lot did not flower.</p>
        <p class="10" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',42)">
             (10) For my friends and my neighbors, even these cast me off, because I did not place
            before them a table of multifarious dishes. For many befriend me, bending a hand to the
            bowl with me, but in adversity I find them like enemies and again they help injure my
            feet; with their eyes they weep with me, but in their heart they laugh at me. Therefore
            do not have faith in a friend, nor trust in a brother.</p>
        <p class="11" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',44)">
             (11) For Prince Rostislav did not lie to me: death would be more fitting for me than
            the Kursk princedom; thus too it is for a man: death is more fitting than life drawn-out
            in destitution. For as Solomon said: give me neither wealth nor poverty, O Lord: if I
            will be wealthy I will assume pride, if I will be poor I will think of theft and
            robbery, and immorality with women.</p>
        <p class="12" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',43,45)">
             (12) Therefore I will cry out to you, grasped by destitution: have mercy on me, O son
            of the great King Vladimer, lest I weep, wailing like Adam for Paradise; let a cloud
            upon the earth of my craft.</p>

        <p class="13" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',13)">
             (13) Because, O lord, a wealthy man is known everywhere, and has friends in a foreign
            land, but a poor man walks hated in his own. A wealthy man speaks forth and all are
            silent and carry up his word to the clouds; but a poor man speaks forth and all shout
            against him. Whose garments are bright, their speech is honored.</p>

    <div class="cd" name="6"><h2>Chapter 6</h2>
        <p class="14" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',47)">
             (14) O my prince, O lord! Deliver me from this destitution, like a goat from a snare,
            like a bird from a trap, like a duck from the claws of a hawk carrying it (off), like a
            sheep from a lion’s mouth.</p>

        <p class="15" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',12)">
             (15) For I am, O prince, like a tree by the path: for many chop it and throw it into
            the fire; thus too I am offended by all, because I am fenced-in by fright of your
            threat.</p>
        <p class="16" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',49,63)">
             (16) For as tin is destroyed when poured too often, thus too is a man who receives much
            misfortune. No one can gobble salt, nor think in sorrow; for every man is clever and
            wise about another’s misfortune, but cannot think about his own. Gold is tried by fire,
            and man by adversity; wheat ground much shows forth clean bread, and in sorrow man finds
            his mind perfected. Moths, O prince, eat garments, and sorrow a man; for a sorrowful
            man’s bones will dry up.</p>
        <p class="17" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',48)">
             (17) If someone looks after a man in sorrow, it is as if he gives him cold water to
            drink on a sweltering day.</p>
        <p class="18" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',57,34,46)">
             (18) For a bird is happy in spring, and an infant with its mother, and we are glad
            under your grasp; spring beautifies the earth with flowers, and you enliven all men with
            your mercy; the sun heats the entire world, and you – orphans and widows, burdened by
            great men.</p>

            your form is beautiful; the comb streams from your mouth and your epistle is like
            Paradise with fruit.</p>
        <p class="20" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',56)">
             (20) But when you are glad with many dishes, remember me, eating dry bread; or (when)
            you drink sweet drink, remember me, drinking warm water and dust that fell from a place
            downwind; when you lie on soft bedding under a sable blanket, remember me, lying under
            one linen and dying in winter and in dripping rains, piercing (my) heart like
            arrows.</p>

             (21) Let not, O my prince, O lord, your hand be closed from giving to the poor: neither
            can one scoop out the sea with a cup, nor can we drain your house by our taking. For
            just as the sea is filled (by) receiving many rivers, just so is your house, because
            your hands are like a forceful cloud, taking up water from the sea – streaming out into
            the hands of the have-nots. For just as a net does not grasp water, only fish alone,
            just so you, O prince, do not grasp gold or silver, but give it out to the people.</p>
        <p class="22" onclick="toggle(this,'molenie',30,32,22)">
             (22) For a brocade, motley with many silks, shows the face beautifully; just so you, O
            prince, are honored and glorified by many people in all lands. For as king Hezekiah
            boasted to the ambassadors of the Babylonian King and indicated to them a multitude of
            gold and silver; and they said: our king is wealthier than you not by a multitude of
            gold but by a multitude of soldiers; for men acquire gold, but by gold men cannot be
            acquired. As said Prince Sviatoslav, Olga's son, going against Constantinople with a
